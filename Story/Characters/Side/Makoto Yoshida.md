### Background
Makoto Yoshida was born into the Yoshida family, a quiet line of retainers who had preserved the **Onami-ryū** (“Great Wave School”) swordsmanship for generations. Unlike many classical schools that became ceremonial or theatrical after the Meiji Restoration, Onami-ryū emphasized adaptability—its philosophy was to move like waves: flowing, crashing, and reforming. This adaptability kept it alive longer than most, though by Makoto’s time, the school had only a handful of adherents.

As a child in Kyoto, Makoto trained under his father from the age of 5. By 16, he was considered one of the most promising swordsmen of his lineage. But the world was moving fast—samurai traditions had little place in modern Japan. Seeking purpose beyond kata and duels of form, Makoto volunteered for the **Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF)**.

**Combat Experience in Real History**

Unlike many who inherited martial traditions but never tested them, Makoto’s life became inseparable from real conflict:
- **Vietnam War (1972–1975)**  
    As a Japanese “unofficial observer,” Makoto volunteered with humanitarian units in South Vietnam. Though Japan was not directly at war, Yoshida embedded with American and ARVN forces as a translator and field medic. Several times he was forced to fight in close quarters when convoys were ambushed. His blade—the same his father passed to him—was carried not as ritual, but as survival.
- **Japanese Red Army Crisis (1970s–1980s)**  
    During the turbulent years of the Japanese Red Army, Makoto served in counter-terrorism support roles, working indirectly with Japanese authorities. He faced hostage scenarios where firearms were unreliable, and once again his training in precise, decisive close-range combat was used in real situations.
- **Middle East Security Contracts (1980s–1990s)**  
    As Japan expanded its interests abroad, Makoto took contracts in **Lebanon** and later **Kuwait**. There he earned a reputation as a man who blended traditional swordsmanship with modern survival instincts—rare, but terrifyingly effective in narrow quarters.

Through these decades, Makoto gained a level of practical experience that few classical martial artists of his generation could ever claim. By the time he retired from active service, he had scars on his body and a weight in his eyes that no dojo sparring partner could understand.

**The Last Heir**

By the late 1990s, Makoto was the last living inheritor of Onami-ryū. The few remaining students either left or abandoned the art for corporate jobs and modern careers. Alone, he quietly maintained the school hall in Kyoto, continuing his father’s lessons in silence.

He often meditated on the wave’s philosophy: _strength is not in resisting the tide, but in flowing with it until the crash is inevitable._ For Makoto, his lineage was already fading. He did not expect to find a student worthy of inheriting Onami-ryū.

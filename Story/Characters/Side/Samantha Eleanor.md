### Background
Samantha is a divorced single mother with one son, Henry White, from her marriage with Alex White. She was married to Alex for 10 years. 
She is the only daughter of Eleanor family. A rich family who owns 'Eleanor Air', a major commercial aviation company. Which since 2015, has been led by her after her parents retirement.
She co-founded [[Stream Corp]] with [[Jonathan Avery]] when she was 21 years old. At the time, she was a prominent young girl, already has many government and commercial connections. Met Jonathan coincidentally in an event where a 9 years old Jonathan demonstrated a prototype of a levitating toy plane using electromagnetic with fine control, she had unknowingly fallen for him and his genius mind. They eventually made acquaintances and met regularly. A year later, using her connections and Jonathan's inventions, they founded [[Stream Corp]], hoping it will be a new front for technological advancements.
Her feelings for Jonathan was unacknowledged for years, denied by her notions of age difference, covered by a facade of a friendship, sealed shut. She eventually married Alex White at 2010, and her son was born a year later. But while deep in her heart she harbors feeling towards Jonathan, she poured herself completely to work. Her husband that she told herself she loved and her son that she actually loves didn't get enough attention. Which resulted in the divorce on 2020, devastating her. 
After the divorce, her feelings shifted in another form. Devastated by her leaving son, she began to see Jonathan – young as he was – as her son. Resulting in a twisted love, a mix between a mother's love for her son and an old unacknowledged love for her man.

### Background
Samantha Eleanor was born into the powerful and affluent Eleanor family, sole heirs of Eleanor Air, one of the most successful commercial aviation companies in the world. From an early age, Samantha lived under the shadow of her family’s influence and wealth, but also bore the burden of their expectations. As the only daughter, she was groomed to carry on the family legacy. When her parents retired in 2015, she stepped into the role of leading Eleanor Air with remarkable precision and skill —*as she has lead Stream Corp for 10 years already*.

At the age of 21 —*10 years before she inherited Eleanor Air*, she co-founded Stream Corp with Jonathan Avery, a young prodigy she met by chance at a scientific event. Jonathan, then only nine years old, had showcased a levitating toy plane powered by advanced electromagnetic control. Samantha, already well-connected and highly regarded in political and business circles, recognized not only the genius of his invention but also the potential in Jonathan himself. Their relationship began innocently enough as a mentorship and friendship, but deep inside, Samantha felt something more—a forbidden spark she denied for years.

By combining her resources and connections with Jonathan’s raw intellect, Stream Corp was born. Together, they built the company into a powerhouse of innovation, a front-runner in futuristic technology. Samantha became both protector and strategist, shielding Jonathan and the company from political storms and guiding it through cutthroat corporate wars.

Her personal life, however, did not share the same success. In 2010, Samantha married Alex White, a man she convinced herself she loved. Their son, Henry White, was born in 2011. Though she cherished Henry, her work and unresolved feelings for Jonathan consumed much of her attention, creating emotional distance within her family. The imbalance grew, and in 2020, after ten years of marriage, Samantha and Alex divorced. The fallout left her devastated, not only because of the loss of stability but also because her son chose to live primarily with his father.

After the divorce, Samantha’s unacknowledged love for Jonathan twisted into something more complex. She began to see him through two lenses: as the brilliant partner she had always admired, and as a surrogate son—someone she needed to protect fiercely, perhaps as a way to mend the wounds left by Henry’s absence. This duality gave birth to a conflicted, layered form of affection: half maternal, half romantic, entirely consuming.

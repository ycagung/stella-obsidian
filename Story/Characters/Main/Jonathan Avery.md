### Background
Jonathan Jones was born to a declining family of mafia called “The Jones”. His parents --not having enough skills and resources to maintain their reputation-- kept making wrong choices all his life. Like leaving him in their mansion at the age of 4 only to be cared by their servants, didn't even recognize Jonathan's talent. That was when he realized his genius mind and kept developing himself further, unnoticed by his parents.
Time passed by as Jonathan managed to build a tech company “Stream Corp.” at the age of 10 under his other identity Jonathan Avery. The company, which at that time was run by a proxy, steadily gaining power with his inventions. Eventually he became a billionaire at the age of 17.
Despite his success, he couldn't bring himself to leave his parent. So he played along as their obedient son, pretending to move from place to place on his parent's command, mostly because of their own blunders. But every time after his parents saw his moving process complete, they ignored him once again, and he slipped himself away from them, into his own life of corporation, innovation, and -sadly- loneliness.
At the age of 25, he successfully created 2 permanent body augmentations. His distrust of the world made him unable to reveal the inventions. He sought a place where he can keep his inventions a secret to the world and found [["The Island"]]. There he built himself [["The House"]] and [["The Underground Base"]], experimented the augmentations on his own body. He succeeded and survived the experiment, gaining **enhanced muscles and metabolism** from the first augmentation and **superhuman reflexes** from the second one, making him the strongest person in the world. He trained alone on the island for about a year to master the powers.

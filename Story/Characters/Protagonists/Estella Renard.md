### Background
Estella was born to a French bloodline, hence her name — _Renard_ (fox) and _Estella Noëlle_ (a star-born gift). Her full name poetically translates to _“a fox born from a star.”_

As an only child, her childhood was bright and hopeful until age twelve, when her parents were killed in a shooting inside a train before her very eyes. That single moment of horror branded her heart with trauma and drove her to pursue strength as the only shield against powerlessness.

Driven by grief and anger, she enlisted in the military as soon as she was of age. She served six years in covert intelligence operations, cutting her teeth on black ops and survival missions where failure was not an option. Her skill with firearms and close combat was formidable, but it was her calm decisiveness under fire that earned her respect and fear in equal measure.

**Meeting Makoto Yoshida**

During one of her military deployments in Japan —*a counterintelligence assignment shadowing foreign assets*— Estella encountered **Makoto Yoshida**, the last master of the fading **Onami-ryū**, an ancient sword style once wielded by battlefield warriors. Makoto, a stoic man in his late sixties, had survived both war and the erosion of tradition in modern Japan.

Their meeting was by chance: Estella, ambushed in an alley by armed assailants, found herself cornered until Makoto intervened. With his odachi, he moved like water —*smooth, flowing, inevitable*— deflecting attacks and cutting them down with a single decisive stroke. For the first time since childhood, Estella felt awe instead of despair in the face of violence.

Recognizing her disciplined mindset, he allowed her to become his sole student. Under Makoto’s tutelage, she studied the philosophy of Onami-ryū:
- **Flow like water** — adapt to the enemy’s rhythm.
- **Deflect, not resist** — turn force against its wielder.
- **One strike decides fate.**

Training under Makoto gave her balance — a way to merge her soldier’s pragmatism with a warrior’s elegance. Yet, she could not stay; her mercenary path soon drew her back into the world of missions, money, and survival. When she departed Japan, Makoto remained alive, still the guardian of Onami-ryū, proud yet saddened to see his only student walk the path of steel and shadow.

**Later Life**

Estella shifted to the private sector after leaving the military, working under various organizations until she became Jonathan Avery’s bodyguard, employed by his family. Unknown to her, this role would bring her closer to her destined path.

In parallel, she became quietly fascinated with Samantha Eleanor —unaware at first that she was the _proxy_ CEO of Stream Corp. Estella followed her trajectory with rare interest, a deviation from her otherwise cold detachment.

Though she lived for missions and paychecks, Estella carried with her the silent philosophy of Makoto’s teaching: the flowing blade, the wave that adapts and crashes. She remains the heir to Onami-ryū — though whether she will carry that legacy forward, or let it fade with Makoto’s twilight years, is a question only destiny will answer.

	- **Confidence**: Unyielding outward confidence, though at times it’s a shield for deep-rooted doubt.

- **Behavior & Habits**

	- **Social Behavior**: A lone-wolf guardian. She fights not out of loyalty but survival instinct.
	- **Daily Habits**: Hyper-disciplined routines: weapon training, physical regimen, strict mealtimes. One ritual never breaks—gazing at stars nightly, seeking silent solace in what she believes is her "destined path."

- **Motivations & Values**
	- **Goals**: Once dreamed of a secluded home beneath a starlit sky, but Jonathan’s "House" already fulfills this. Now haunted by the emptiness of achieving her dream too soon, she searches for a **new meaning** beyond survival.

	    - “Lives can be currency.”        
	    - “The sword chooses who deserves to live.”
	    - “Destiny is not kind, but it is inevitable.”
	- **Priorities**:
	    1. Her mission (survival or contract).
	    2. Her pay (pragmatic motivator).
	    3. Jonathan (an unspoken, conflicting priority growing inside her).

	    - _Severe_: Reckless bursts, sometimes lethal overkill.
	    - _Overwhelming_: Paralyzed by resurfacing childhood trauma—frozen, unable to act.
	- **Treatment of Others**:
	    - **Partner (Jonathan)**: Paradoxical—ready to tear the world apart for him, yet pushes him away with coldness.
	    - **Family**: Dead, and she does not entertain surrogate replacements.
	    - **Friends**: Keeps them at blade’s length.

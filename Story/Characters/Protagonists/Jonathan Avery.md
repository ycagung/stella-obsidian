### Background
Jonathan Jones was born into the once-feared but rapidly declining mafia family, **The Jones**. His parents, Hensen and Martha, lacked the foresight and skill to maintain their power and wealth, often making reckless decisions that led to the family’s downfall. At just 4 years old, Jonathan was left in their mansion, raised more by servants than his own parents. Despite their neglect, he discovered his prodigious intelligence early on and secretly began cultivating his talents.

By age 10, Jonathan had already founded **Stream Corp** under the alias _Jonathan Avery_. To avoid drawing suspicion, he placed management of the company in the hands of a trusted proxy, [[Samantha Eleanor]]. His groundbreaking inventions propelled the company to international prominence, and by 17, Jonathan was already a billionaire.

Even with his wealth and independence, Jonathan maintained a facade of obedience to his parents. He followed their orders to move from city to city, pretending to comply while in reality disappearing into his world of innovation and corporate dominance. His parents, blind to his achievements, treated him as an afterthought, fueling his growing loneliness.

At 25, Jonathan turned his brilliance inward. Distrustful of humanity and unwilling to reveal his most dangerous discoveries, he developed two **permanent body augmentations**. On [["The Island"]], within the safety of [["The House"]] and [["The Underground Base"]], he experimented on himself:
- **First Augmentation**: Enhanced musculature and metabolic efficiency – granting him extraordinary strength and stamina.
- **Second Augmentation**: Superhuman reflexes – allowing him to react faster than any human alive.

He survived both procedures, becoming physically unmatched. For the next year, he trained in isolation to master his enhanced abilities, preparing himself for challenges the world was not yet ready to face.

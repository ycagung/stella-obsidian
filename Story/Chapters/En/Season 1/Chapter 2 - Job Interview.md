### Story

"Who are you?", Estella threw her question to Jonathan's face.

Glancing at her from the pilot seat, Jonathan said, "Come sit down first", pointing to co-pilot seat beside him. Estella walked toward it and sat there without releasing her gaze at Jonathan.

"You're asking the wrong question. At least the order is wrong", Jonathan said.

"Is that so?", she rebutted. "Am I wrong questioning the identity of someone whom capabilities doesn't match my file at all? Whose hands can move faster than my eyes can track? Who can summon a flying ... 'thing' that's transparent and has this kind of interior?", she laid her questions one by one, hard.

Jonathan answered with, "No, but you can ask that later. For now, shouldn't you be questioning who attacked us earlier? They didn't seem to wear any family insignia. And even if we assumed they were from a mafia family, their gears and weapons were to professionals, their movements were too orderly. Doesn't that bothered you?"

After Jonathan's answer – and questions –. Estella was just recognized some of the facts Jonathan had stated. "You are right ...", her words trailed off.

"Besides, I'm as surprised as you are right now, I just saw someone DEFLECTS BULLET. What the hell was that?!", Jonathan added.

Deliberately ignoring Jonathan's comment on her skill, she inquired more on who were attacking them. "So who do you think was attacking us earlier?", she asked.

"I don't know yet, I have to do more digging at the base. Most likely an intelligence agency from some random country", shrugged his shoulder, Jonathan answered.

"INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FROM SOME RANDOM COUNTRY, YOU SAY?! What did they want from someone like ...", her shouting suddenly stopped when she reminded of the accurate intel on Jonathan's laptop AND the fact that she was in this weird flying contraption. "Never mind, it make sense now", she said. "Your laptop! We left it there!", she jolted up as she remembered that they left Jonathan's laptop back at the apartment. "No worries, I left it on purpose after burning the contents. Now, your questions about my identity", Jonathan shifted the conversation. 

"Do you know that I have another name?", he asked Estella. "There was no such thing in your files. What other name?", she asked him back, readying herself for whatever surprising thing he was about to say.

"I have another identity with the name 'Jonathan Avery'", his answer only gained a raised eyebrow from Estella. *"Not surprising at all, though"*, thought she.

"Do you know Stream Corp.?", Jonathan asked. Estella immediately recognized the company name and nodded, "Of course I know. The biggest tech company in the world. Founded about twenty years ago and already supplying most of the world's demand on renewable energy, military devices, even commercial ones, right? What about it?".

"Oh, you know quite much aren't you? I'm the founder and its owner", Jonathan answered, while operating consoles in front of him.

"No way! The founder was Samantha Eleanor and she owns it. The coolest woman in the world, I've idolized her for so long. She was so beautiful, smart, and charismatic. How dare you took her accomplishment as your own?!", Estella furiously yelled at Jonathan only to found him showing her contact on his phone. With a nasty grin.

"Yes, Samantha is smart, beautiful, and charismatic indeed. Too beautiful for me even", Jonathan winked at Estella and pressed 'Call' button on Samantha's phone number. Estella's tongue tied itself as the phone sounded the dial tone on speaker. *'He lied, of course. Right?'*, thought she.

With only a single dial tone, the call connected. Samantha's voice from the other side can be heard clearly, *"Good morning, Jonathan. To what do I own the pleasure of your call so early in the morning?"*.

"Good morning, Samantha. Ah, I'm sorry for waking you up. I forgot that it's 7 AM there. I'm in Milan right now", Samantha heard Jonathan's relaxed answer. Meanwhile, Jonathan could see Estella in front of him, jaw dropper, wide-eyed, clearly had been stripped of her ability to talk.

*"Oh, in Milan? Will you be so kind as to bring me some coffee as souvenirs?"*, Samantha's voice was hoarse as she was waking from her sleep, a bit sexy.

"I've prepared it, don't worry. I'll be stopping by the office this afternoon, Samantha. I'm bringing a secret guest, please see me on the helipad. See you".

*"Okay, Jonathan. Safe travel, okay? See you at the office"*, Samantha answered before ending the call.

I turned my eyes to Estella and saw her 'I just saw a ghost' expression. "What's with your face? Hello? Anybody home?", his hand waving in front of Estella's eyes.

Estella felt her head hurts from the amount of surprises and information. "You know Samantha Eleanor?", finally gained her ability to speak again, though weak.

"What are you talking about? Of course I know her, I made public recognized her as the founder and owner of Stream Corp. I think I've already told you that I'm the real founder and owner, haven't I?", Jonathan answered her with a smile in his eyes.

"Hold on, if you really are the founder and owner, then Stream Corp was founded when you were ...", Estella counted in her mind, "10 YEARS OLD?!". Jonathan felt like his eardrum bursting from Estella's yelling. "What kind of nonsense is this?! In what world does a 10 years old kid founded an entire company?!", she yelled again.

Jonathan just smiled as widely as he can and hold his index finger up, like a student answering their teacher's question. "The answer lies in Samantha's presence. She helped me founded Stream Corp."

"And where was your parents at that time?! Did they know?! It should be in your files, right?!", Samantha was still pressing her questions on Jonathan.

"They didn't know, not then, not now. Really painting their foolishness on how to manage their own organization, right?", he answered, still smiling. "They left me with the servants when I was 4 years old. A few years later they said that it was because something endangered their lives", he added. Estella's expression softened at Jonathan's story about his parents. She too has to face childhood trauma where she saw her parents got killed, but imagining Jonathan went through all those years ignored by his parents, a bit of sadness surfaced in her heart.

"Enough with that, Estelle. I have a proposition for you", Jonathan closed the private press conference. Estella's body tensed hearing Jonathan's word. "Come work with me. It's a waste for someone of your ability to still be working for my parents", Estella's eyes widened instantly at Jonathan's direct proposition.

"Wait, I can't do this. I have to compose myself first", she requested. "This jet has a toilet, right?", she asked. "It's on the back. That white door", Jonathan pointed to one of the doors behind them. Estella hurried herself to the toilet.

Inside the toilet, she washed her face, took a deep breath, and cursed in her heart. *'What in hell's chamber is this situation?!'*.

A few minutes later, Estella got out of the toilet and sat back down beside Jonathan. "Alright, you want to recruit me. Why? For what position?", she asked Jonathan straight to the point.

"As my secret security, the only ones who'll know of you are me and Samantha. You'll only answer to me. And your job is to safeguard the data center in my base. Because that database is the intersection of all the Internet's most important traffic, it holds the world's secret. From the fun ones to the darkest, stinkiest ones", Jonathan paused. "If you ask me why, well, because I think you have the capability and are responsible enough to do this".

"Data security? I'm not a hacker or something like that. I know how to operate software and computers just well enough for what my mission usually requires", Estella explained herself.

"No need, my data center is unbreachable, at least by a conventional computers that is. What I mean by 'protecting' is to do missions to eliminate some dangerous threat that was or will be detected. At the end of the day, this data center will protect itself through you. All this time I've been doing it myself because there's no one I can trust that has the capability and is responsible enough. But I got a hunch that you can be trusted", Jonathan explained what her job situation will look like.

"Okay, let's say I agreed to your request. What makes you think I – alone – can do those missions well? A hunch too?", Estella started to feel intrigues by this supposed to be genius's way of thinking, in which he trusted his hunch to determine some important decision.

"Yep! You're absolutely right", Jonathan answered shortly.

Estella could only slap her hand to her forehead while mumbling, "Aren't you supposed to be a genius?" after hearing Jonathan's answer. "And what about you parents? If I suddenly went dark, they'll realize something is wrong", she asked.

"Let them. They can't find you anyway. I'm not detecting any tracker in your body, so they couldn't have planted something in you", said Jonathan while moving his hand like swatting a fly, indicating that it wasn't a problem worth concerning about.

Estrella was then reflecting for a minute. Weighing her options and finally asked the final question to seal – or not sealing – the deal, "How much will you pay me? Just so you know, your parents pay me quite the sum. And I don't want to move over to a new place just to be paid less".

Jonathan chuckled at the question and asked her back, "How much are my parents paying you?".

"$100,000 per year, complete with employee benefits", said Estella, short. She was wondering what will Jonathan's counteroffer be.

"Benefits? What benefits?", he asked. "Well, regular benefits. Insurance, PTO, dental care, transportation, that kind of things". After hearing that answer, Jonathan exploded into a loud laughter, surprising Estella. "What's funny?", she asked, furious.

"Dental care? What? You slashed your teeth while deflecting bullets?", Jonathan answered while laughing. Estella's fury only grew stronger seeing Jonathan's attitude of making a serious matter a joke.

"Dental care is IMPORTANT. Don't tell me Stream Corp can't give its employees proper dental care?", she challenged him.

Jonathan laughter didn't subside for a minute. Then he answered, "Sorry, sorry ... Hahaha ... It's just funny, a skilled swordsman talking about how important dental care is", Estella pouted at his comment. "Okay. I'll give you twice the amount for salary at $200,000 per year. With all ... Hahaha ... You precious benefits", there, Jonathan laid his offer. Estella's eyes widen instantly again.

"$200,000?? Are you sure?", she was looking for some kind of joke on Jonathan's face but found nothing. Jonathan nodded firmly while wiping his laughter tears. "O-okay ... Good offer. I accept".

Jonathan extended his hand to Estella. "Welcome aboard, Estella Rennard", Estella extended her hand too and they shook on it.

After they shook hands, Estella asked. "You said on the phone that we'll stop by at the HQ this afternoon. Does that mean I can meet Ms. Samantha?", her voice nervous, she was imagining a meeting with someone whom she has idolized for a long time. 

"Yes! You can meet Samantha and have her signature tattooed on you back later. Hahaha!", Jonathan answered, laughing hard yet again.

"Oh, shut up! Everyone can have their own idols!", Estella glared at Jonathan furiously. "But I think something weird is going on. You said 'this afternoon' to Samantha, can we still make it?", she asked.

"We're halfway there, will arrive in one hour", said Jonathan, laid back.

"ONE HOUR?! We have been flying for one hour too, that means Milan to New York in 2 hours?! How fast are we going exactly?!", she yelled again, pressing Jonathan for answers.

"Hey, hey, my eardrums will burst open if you keep yelling at me whenever you hear something surprising – to you –. We are now stable at Mach 3.5. What about it?", Jonathan answered while rubbing his ears.

"MACH 3.5?! We have been flying faster than the sound all this time?!", still yelling at him. Jonathan couldn't do anything beside closing his ears. Actually, Estella has solid grounds to be surprised. Because for one hour they have been flying, she didn't feel any significant acceleration, no shaking inside the cockpit, even the sound of their conversation could be heard clearly. None of those reflects the supersonic speed they flew in.

"Yes, that's right. You didn't feel anything, right? The suspension is indeed good", Jonathan answered lightly while winking at her, continued with "This Hover Jet can fly twice that speed, but ten times more uncomfortable".

Hearing that, Estella slumped in her seat. *'Mach 7'*, she said in her mind. *'Good suspension, my butt! Whatever, I give up being surprised'*.

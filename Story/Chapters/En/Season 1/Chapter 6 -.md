### Story

Samantha opened her eyes on her bed. It was 6 AM, as per usual. She uncovered her blanket, revealing her body in black nightgown. Memories of the day before flashed quickly in her mind. Jonathan introduced a girl with a wolf cut dark blue hair, her expression was sharp and her eyes sharper. But how she carried herself showed a rare kind of elegance. Her slender body and a sword attached on her hip just highlighted the elegance all the more. *'A fox'*, she said in her mind. Her motherly instinct to Jonathan lit up immediately. Evaluating whether the girl was a threat or not. But even after a day of interactions, she hasn't reached a conclusion. She set the thought away for now.

Samantha stood up gracefully. Rays of morning sun from her all glass window bathe her body. She walked to her en suite bath room, shedding her nightgown on the way. Her beautiful figure and curves looked like a silhouette of a goddess from the other side of her room. The bathroom door then closed with a 'click' after she entered.

A few hours later, Samantha was already sitting in her office. Operating her computer and making some queries, she started digging deeper into Golden Serpent Tong. Not long after, she already collected a bunch of digital records documenting their movements for 2 years. Turns out the organization weren't so dead to not be able to revive. Jonathan was right, another hand was in play in their movements. A lot of accounting records proved it. Now her objective became clear.

"Now I just have to follow the money", she mumbled. She spent the next hour collecting more accounting records and compiling it. It was a very complicated flow of money. *'Who the hell in mafia world did fund transfers this meticulous? This will take me too long to figure out'*, she said in her mind. A new node of data was created filled with her finding. *'I'll just ask AEGIS to figure this out'*.

"AEGIS, wake up", she called.

"Good day, Miss", a cybernetic voice answered her from her office's speaker.

"Track the accounting records in this node, it's from Golden Serpent Tong. Find if there's any connecting line with Jonathan's attack", she commanded.

"Very well, Miss. Commencing analysis".

*'That will take a while'*.

Samantha suddenly reminded of her curiosity from yesterday about Estella. She immediately opened up a new data node, she called it *Fox Girl*. "Let's find out more about you, shall we?", she said before starting the search.

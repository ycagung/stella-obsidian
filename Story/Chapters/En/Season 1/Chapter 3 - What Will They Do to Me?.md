### Story

The Hover Jet descended below the clouds, revealing a magnificent view of New York city. In the middle of that view, stood a tall skyscraper with 'Stream' written vertically on its glass walls. Estella had seen the same building multiple times, whether while driving by or from the Internet, but she never saw it from above like this. She can only marvel by the weird construction —*which was a spiral*— of the building, stood taller than other buildings around it. "Wow", she mumbled.

"Are we not drawing any attention flying above the city like this?", Estella asked Jonathan.

"Transparent, remember? And will still be after we landed", Jonathan answered, gained her nodding.

"But, it must be noisy when we landed. right? Ah ...", her tongue tied, remembering she didn't hear any engine noise even when the Jet was hovering above Milan. "... Why didn't I hear any engine noise since Milan?". Jonathan answered, "Oh, you just noticed? This Jet's propulsion system is an electromagnetic one, a bit different from a conventional combustion jet on the market. It's very silent, barely warm even, very effective", while raising his thumb and grinned. "Cool, right?", he added.

Estella, who was already tired by the consecutive surprises from earlier, could only accept it with a straight face, "Cool indeed, boss", also thumbing up.

They landed on the Stream Headquarters helipad, the back door opened and they walked out. Samantha was already waiting there with a smile, standing straight with her hands enclosed on her stomach. A polite posture. She was wearing gray suit and pencil skirt. Her topmost shirt was open, revealing her cleavage and an elegant gold necklace. Estella was instantly stunned by the sight of her.

"Hello, Jonathan. Is this your secret guest?", Samantha said opening the conversation.

"Hey, Samantha, looking good as always, did you miss me already?", said Jonathan with a wink. It gained Samantha's laughter and light tap on his arm. "Don't start hitting on me, this old heart can't take it". Jonathan joined her laughter. Seeing Jonathan and Samantha exchanging light banter so close like that, Estella raised her eyebrow. *'Are they ... dating? I can't be right?'*.

"Ah, Samantha, this is Estella. She was my parent's employee before. Now she works with me", Jonathan introduced Estella to Samantha. Estella extended her hand to Samantha, "A pleasure to meet you, ma'am. I've been following your journey since long", she said, nervously. Samantha shook her hand and replied. "Good to meet you too, Estella. Why do you look nervous?", she asked curiously.

"She's a big fan of yours, Samantha", Jonathan said, pretending to whisper. "She said you're like Whitney Houston in the business world", he added, gaining Estella's glare. "Ah, why didn't you say so? Just relax, Estella. I'm just like your everyday woman", Samantha said with a wink to Estella.

"This information is just for our ears, Samantha. Treat Estella like my other 'assets', nobody on the inside or outside should know".

Jonathan's word made both of them raised their eyebrows.

*'Other assets? What assets?'*, Estella thought. 

*'Treated like his assets? How special is this girl?'*, Samantha thought

But Samantha could only nod and said, "Okay, Jonathan, I understand".

"You guys hungry?", Jonathan asked, out of nowhere. Both Samantha and Estella raised their eyebrows for the second time. "Let's go eat. We have important work to do after", said Jonathan while walking to the rooftop door. Samantha and Estella could only exchange glances while shaking their heads.

"Does he always do that?", Estella asked, nervous. "Yes he does, you can't predict his train of thought. A minute he was so serious and couldn't be disturbed, the next minute he acted like a spoiled kid asking for food or coffee", she answered, shrugging her shoulders.

"Come on, my girls!", Jonathan shouted from the doorway.

"I'm not YOUR girl!", Estella said

"I'm not A girl!", Samantha said

Both of them shouted at the same time while they walked toward Jonathan.

The three of them went down to eat at a restaurant on 5<sup>th</sup> floor. "Your headquarters feels nice, I thought it would just be Stream's offices here. The food was good too", Estella commented after she finished eating. "I'm too lazy to eat out while working, so I just opened a restaurant. Simple solution", he replied. "There are food courts too upstairs if you prefer something simpler", Samantha added. "Ah, yes, ma'am", Estella answered to Samantha, shyly. "Okay, I'm full. Let's move to my office", Jonathan stood up. He then walked along with the 'girls' to the elevator.

A few minutes later, they all have arrived at Jonathan's office. It was a large space with minimalists style and decorations, in the middle there was a big work desk. Jonathan moved towards the desk and a few hologram displays showed up. "Wow", Estella mumbled, moved herself closer to the hologram. "These holograms really are high resolution", her hands waved through the holograms. Seeing Estella's amazed antics, Samantha showed an amused smile, "Your new friend is clearly entertaining", she said. "Come on, country bumpkin. Let's focus on the pressing matters first, I'll give you special toys to play later", Jonathan gestured to a wall with his chin. Estella averted her attention to the five-meter-tall wall and a big hologram display surfaced on it. "WOW!", Estella was shocked. Ignoring her, Jonathan laid out his explanations.

"Earlier this morning, forty men tried to ambush us in my apartment in Milan", a map reading and photos of a bunch of men from the apartment CCTV showed up on the wall hologram. "Each of them wore a bulletproof vest —*I have to shoot them right in the face*, advanced communication devices, and was fully armed too the teeth, from handguns to assault rifles, all military standard". The display changed to some video cuts from the CCTV, zoomed in, to view their equipment and weapons. "Based on their movements, I can safely say that their objectives was to kidnap me and took out anyone guarding me. See this, all of them have handcuffs, batons, and taser gun", the hologram zoomed in again to show their handcuffs, batons, and taser gun on their belt. "It looked like they were surprised that I just walked out of the apartment room and took out two of their men". Now the display showed Jonathan walking out to the corridor and shot the enemies on his left and right. "Right away, their purpose shifted from 'kidnapping' to 'subdue with force'. Luckily, we can handle them", the display showed a scene where Estella deflected a bullet and beheaded her enemy. "What? You deflected a bullet??", Samantha asked Estella. "Yes, ma'am. Coincidentally", her modest answer was instantly denied by the next scene where she was deflecting bullets multiple time and slashed her opponents one by one on the corridor leading to the rooftop. "So that's why you want me to treat her like your other 'assets'?", Samantha turned her wide-eyed gaze to Jonathan. The man in question just shrugged and smiled.

"Is there any possibility that this was your parent's doing", Samantha asked. Jonathan pointed to Estella, "She was there, protecting me, why bother sending a bodyguard just to be followed by a strike team?". "Maybe she's here to spy on you in the event you managed to escape?", her gaze turned to Estella, pretended to be suspicious. Estella panicked, "No ma'am! I wasn't to Jonathan to do that! I was just ordered to bodyguard him". "Enough Samantha, I trust Estella. She's not the kind of person who can be a double agent. Besides, my parents aren't that smart", Jonathan said. Samantha shifted her gaze from Estella, "Okay, then. I believe you", she said to Jonathan. Estella sighed in relief, *'Her gaze was so intense, it frightened me'*, she thought.

Jonathan operated his computer and a face showed up at the display. *"Good day, Jonathan, Ms. Samantha. What can I do to help?"*, the face spoke. "Hello, AEGIS. Please track past movements of the forty people that attacked me this morning, and summarize the historical report from the last seven days", Jonathan commanded. *"Very well, Jonathan. Commencing search now ..."*, the face disappeared, replaced by an empty blue screen and many text came and went in a high speed.

Estella, who has been wondering who was the face finally spoke, "Who's that? Your partner from a remote place?". Jonathan replied while looking at the display, "It's AEGIS, my artificial intelligence". "Artificial intelligence? Like the ones trending on the Internet?", she asked. "Yes and no. On one hand, it's much smarter and thorough. But was built based on the same theory, 'Neural Network'", Jonathan answered. Estella nodded. "He doesn't like AEGIS. Said that it lacks personality?", Samantha said to Estella. "Personality? What personality?", she asked back. "Yes, lacks personality. Chatting with AEGIS is not as fun as chatting with either of you. Lately I've been asking Samantha to chat with it —AEGIS, so that it can learn her speech. But she always refused", Jonathan explained. "I clearly chose to do something FUN that talking with your creation, Jonathan", she nagged at him, pouting.

*"Search complete. Summary of the search: 32 of 40 people were detected arriving in a flight from China with different arrival time and used indirect flight plan. Ranging from 1 to 3 days before the attack. They stayed in five different hotels"*, AEGIS explanation was accompanied by a lot of tables on the display, showing flight plans, hotels, and passports.

"Impressive details. Where does it know that those people was the ones attacking us?", Estella asked. "It read through a lot of CCTV records from a lot of places and establishments until it finds their faces. The eight undetected people means it couldn't find their faces", Jonathan explained.

"I don't remember having any enemies in China. Am I right, Samantha?", Jonathan asked Samantha. "Our relationship with China's government is pretty good. I don't think it's possible that the attack came from China itself, at least not officially", Samantha replied.

*"Report, data shows there's a triad organization in China that Stream Corp dismantled when opening a production facility in Shenzhen in 2012. It was named 'Golden Serpent Tong'"*, AEGIS interrupted suddenly. "Not only lacks personality, it lacks manners too", Jonathan said. Gained Samantha's chuckle.

"Jīn Shé Táng, I remember that name. They were pretty big in Shenzhen and were adamantly refusing to let us in", Samantha said. "But for a dead organization, their equipment and weapons were too good", Jonathan denied. Meanwhile, wide-eyed Estella could only hear as they talked about 'dismantling' a triad organization like having breakfast.

"Anyway. It's clear that there's something weird going on here. My guts are telling me that there's another party at play on that attack. Maybe more than one. Because they can seem to dodge AEGIS's full detection", Jonathan took a conclusion.

"I agree, we have to thread more carefully", Samantha added.

"Is there anything you want to add, Estella?", Jonathan asked. Estella shook her head.

"Okay, please dig more into this matter for now, Samantha. Use our connections in China", Jonathan commanded. Samantha nodded.

"I'll contact you right away if anything shows up. I can call you in the middle of the night, right?", Samantha asked with a luring tone.

Estella stunned, *'Eh?'*.

"Call away, we usually talked until morning anyway", Jonathan answered.

Estella started to sweat, *'Talk until morning?'*.

"If it's urgent, maybe I'll need you to come right away to my house. *Like usual*", Samantha added with a more tantalizing pose. Her hands crossed, highlighting her chest more.

Estella was sweating profusely, *'Coming to her house at night? Like usual?'*.

"Do I need to take Estella too?", Jonathan asked with a grin.

*'Taking me for what exactly?!'*, her hands started to shake.

"That is if she's still awake. Maybe she's tired after *playing with me*", Jonathan added.

"Don't go too hard on her, Jonathan. She's still young", Samantha answered, still in her sexy pose.

*'WHAT IS THIS?! What are they talking about? What will they do to me?*, Estella couldn't take it anymore. She raised her face to start talking. But she found Jonathan right in front of her, his —turns out— handsome face bathed in glorious rays of a setting sun, his brown eyes was looking right at her. Beside him was Samantha, her beautiful face also bathed with the same glorious rays of a setting sun, her black eyes was looking right at her too.

"So, Estella. Do you want to spend the night with me or Samantha?", Jonathan asked calmly, his tone warm. Estella's face reddened completely, looking like a strawberry.

"I-I ..."

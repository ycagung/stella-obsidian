### Story

"So, Estella. Do you want to spend the night in my house or Samantha's?", Jonathan asked softly. Estella's face reddened like a strawberry.

"I-I ...", she couldn't answer. Her tongue tied, faced with impossible choices from the two person in front of her.

"Looks like she will explode soon", Jonathan whispered to Samantha. "Yeah, now I'm confused on which one she actually interested, a man or a woman?", Samantha replied, whispering too. Unfortunately their whispering could be heard by Estella, her lips started pouting. "You guys really are ... ANNOYING BOSSES!!", she shouted funny words. She actually wanted to curse but felt inappropriate, so her mouth only spat out funny words like 'annoying bosses'. Jonathan and Samantha was bursting into laughter.

Samantha stepped forward and took Estella's face into the embrace of her bosom. "Now, now, we were just messing with you", she said while stroking Estella's hair. Felt no response or retaliation, Samantha stepped back releasing Estella from her embrace. Estella's redder face revealed, her eyes blank. "Hello? Anybody there?", Jonathan waved his hand to Estella's eyes. "Looks like your chest killed her, Samantha. A very dangerous weapon", Jonathan said as he averted his gaze to Samantha, then shook his head. "Hmm, maybe. It seems I have to be careful with these chest", she said looking at her cleavage.

A few minutes later, Estella surfaced back to the real world after being 'killed' by Samantha's chest. She saw Jonathan and Samantha sat down on a couch with a pizza. "Oh, hello! Back from the dead already?", Jonathan said to Estella. "Samantha's chest is truly deadly. Come, sit here and eat some pizza", he added. Samantha patted the spot next to her for Estella to sit. "Eh? OH?! Apologies, ma'am! I was so surprised earlier", she had just remembered Samantha embraced her face into her bosom. She hurriedly sat beside Samantha shyly. "It's okay, even I was surprised. Turns out my chest can have such impact *on women*", Samantha chuckled. Estella took a slice of pizza and ate with a happy face, feeling content inside her new circle.

"Estella, where do you live now?", Jonathan asked. "I live in The Jones compound. Why?", the girl answered while munching her pizza. "Are there any important stuff?", Jonathan asked the next question. "No, I have my sword here", she pointed at her sword leaning on the wall. "Just some clothes", she added. "Very well, I can buy you new clothes. No need to fetch stuff in dad's compound", instructed Jonathan. "Do you want me to live here right away, Jonathan?", Estella asked, tilting her face. "Not here, you'll live with me", answered the man. "With you?! Is this a new joke?", Estella was immediately suspicious of his words. "It's not a joke, Estella. As his secret security, you'll live with Jonathan. You'll learn why later", Samantha said softly, calming her down. "Yes, ma'am", Estella immediately complied. "Hey! Why did you immediately obey Samantha's words and not mine?", Jonathan complained. "Maybe because you're an annoying boss", she answered, her tongue stuck out. Samantha chuckled seeing both of them.

About an hour later, the three of them were already move to the rooftop, preparing to leave. Estella held her sword, Jonathan opened Hover Jet's backdoor. "Safe travel, you two", Samantha said. "Okay, Samantha. See you", Jonathan said and went in the Hover Jet. Estella bowed at Samantha and followed Jonathan. The back door closed after they took their seats and The Jest took off leaving Samantha on the rooftop.

"So, where is your house? Why are we taking The Jet again?", Estella asked. "Not too far away, about 30 minutes by this Jet. You can get some shut-eye, I'll wake you up later", Jonathan said. *'30 minutes by this supersonic Jet is pretty far'*, she thought. Alas she was too lazy to ask, and just shut her eyes.

<center>***</center>

"Estella, wake up. We're descending", Jonathan called. Estella immediately opened her eyes and saw the clouds opened under the night sky. Down below they could see vast open sea and a big island —*about a quarter of New York City big*, surrounded by beaches and cliffs. Tall trees and vegetation, a lake, and a clearing —about two soccer field wide— could be spotted on the island. "Wow, so beautiful", she mumbled. They landed on the clearing. Turns out there were a three story modern minimalist house on the middle of the clearing. Its light glowed softly in the darkness of the night. "Is this your house?", Estella asked after she walked out of the Hover Jet. "Yes, this is my house", Jonathan answered and held Estella's shoulder, shifting her position a bit. The ground below where they were standing splitted open gradually and the Hover Jet was being lowered into the opening. "Valet parking", Jonathan winked at her after releasing his hold to her shoulder. Estella's jaw dropped, either because of Jonathan's sudden touch on the shoulder or the Hover Jet's valet parking to and underground hangar.

Jonathan have already reached his front door, "Come on in. Make yourself comfortable". He opened the door and let Estella in. Estella followed Jonathan who was walking to the kitchen. The house's interior was in minimalist style, like how a rich person decorated their houses. But nothing was strange, no holograms, no weapon storage, or a talking robot. "This house is really nice. But why isn't there anything strange?", she asked. Jonathan has already reached the kitchen and were making two glasses of coffee, "And my house is supposed to be weird?", he asked back. "There's nothing normal that I found from the first time we met", Estella shrugged. Jonathan handed the coffee to Estella, "Watch out, it's hot. Well, maybe you're right. Come on, I'll show you strange stuff you asked for".

Jonathan walked to the elevator, followed by Estella still holding her glass of coffee. They arrived to a big tube of glass in the middle of the house. "Level nine, exhibition mode", and the elevator opened. *'Calm down, it's just an underground dungeon'*, she thought while getting into the elevator. The elevator closed and they started going down.

Elevator kept going down slowly in *'Exhibition Mode'*. The transparent tube revealed everything outside of it. From a hangar, research center, medical facility, and a lot more. Estella's jaw dropped on how comprehensive Jonathan's facility. *'Underground dungeon my butt, this is more like an underground headquarters'*.

They arrived on level 9, an armory. It looked like a regular logistic warehouse with many racks, but filled with various weapons and ammunition.

"This is my armory. Cool, right?", Jonathan asked, gained no answer. After putting down her glass of coffee, Estella's gaze was examining each weapons stored in that warehouse. There were conventional ones, and there were also weird weapons that she hadn't seen before. "These weapons look very advanced. I haven't seen something like these", Estella took something that looked like an assault rifle, just with a barrel diameter of 5 cm. Jonathan hurriedly approached her, "Hey, hey. You don't know how to use this yet. It's dangerous. It can shoot a laser beam that will easily melt one-meter-deep concrete wall". Estella quickly handed the rifle to Jonathan, "Sorry. I was just curious". Jonathan put the rifle back to the rack.

"Come here. I'll give you your first toy", Jonathan took her to a corner where a lot of handguns were being stored and displayed. "Please, take your pick", he gave her 3 handgun options. All three has different calibers, sizes, and models.

Estella examined the three options. The first one was a modified 1911, with .45 ACP caliber, a bit heavy with low magazine capacity. The second one was also a modified one, but from 2311. Chambered in 9 mm, not too heavy and has 21 round magazine. But the barrel was too long, 5 inches. *'Both of these don't match my small body'*. Her eyes landed on the third option, a modified Sig Sauer P365. Chambered in 9 mm, 10 round magazine, and a barrel length of only 3.1 inches. "I think I'll take this one", she said holding the P365. "Good choice, it suits you. It doesn't have a lot of features, but almost no recoil too", Estella nodded after Jonathan's explaining. "Let's move to level 8", said Jonathan. Estella followed her after holstering her new handgun on her back. "Don't forget you coffee", he added. Estella hurriedly took her coffee glass, embarrassed.

They arrived at level 8 —Research Facility 2— and went into a white room. There were a lot of glass boxes containing various accessories. Necklaces, rings, bracelets, you name it. "It's like a jewelry here", Estella commented on the room. Jonathan was operating a computer in the corner of the room. "A very high-tech jewelry. Please stand on the platform. And just laid your sword on the table on your right, I'll upgrade it later.", he said. A circle platform with a soft white glow raised itself in the middle of the room. Estella put her coffee and her sword down and hesitantly stepped onto the platform, "What then?". "Take off your clothes now", said Jonathan lightly. Still looking at his computer.

Estella immediately yelled, "What?! What kind of order is that?! You're maybe my boss but that doesn't mean you can just order me to get naked on a whim!".

Jonathan moved his gaze onto her, eyebrow raised. "The platform where you stand will give you new outfits. The clothes you're wearing now will be torn apart if you don't take it off, *all of it*. If you want that, be my guest", he added.

Estella got confused and pondered for a minute. "Okay, but I'll kill you if you peek", she said, agreeing to it. She was actually a bit offended at the fact that Jonathan was completely uninterested in seeing her body, *'Am I THAT bland?'*. But alas she took off her clothes one by one from her suit, shirt, pants, and her undergarments. "Done, be quick", she commanded Jonathan.

"Yes, ma'am", he answered shortly, then pressed a button. Estella's body quickly wrapped in a combat suit made of nanoparticles that came from the platform where she stood.

A high-neck, sleeveless black top wrapped her upper body tightly. Accentuated her chest and waist curves beautifully. A black sim-fit pants wrapped her waist down to her ankle, completed with a belt for her sword. Her boots was slim, black, and feels light. All of it highlighted by her black open coat with long sleeves, extended just below her waist.

Jonathan whistled, Estella was very stunned by her own appearances. "Wow, this is so cool! The material is breathable and flexible", she said happily while trying to move her body. "Hey, wait a minute, miss. We're not yet done, there's one more outfit", Jonathan said. Estella stood back again on the platform, now more obedient. Jonathan pressed the button again and the combat suit unraveled, replaced by a black formal outfit.

Her top was a strapless low-cut one, exposing her collarbone and cleavage. Added with a fitted black blazer. Paired with high-waisted black pants that are slim and tailored and. Completed the look were a black belt and a pair of pointed black high heels. She looked like a young CEO of a powerful startup.

"Jonathan! This outfit is beautiful! It's so elegant and sexy. I didn't know that you're secretly a fashion designer", she shouted merrily. "I'm not, that's an expensive designer clothes. I just remade it using nanotechnology", he answered.

Estella was so happy with her new outfits that she came down from the platform and hugged Jonathan from behind. "Thank you, boss. Looks like you're not as annoying as it seemed", she said with a wide smile. "Typical women, happiest when you give her something", Jonathan grumbled. Estella released her hug still with a smile when Jonathan stood up, handing her a shining black ring. "Jonathan ...", Estella swallowed her tongue. "Maybe this is too soon", she added. "This is a ring for you CLOTHES", Jonathan said, still grumbling. "Oh, I thought ...", her face reddened from her misunderstanding.

"Wear that ring and speak in your mind, the keywords are 'combat' or 'formal'", he commanded. Estella hurriedly followed his commands to hide her embarrassment. When she said *'combat'* in her mind, her outfit instantly unraveled and went into the ring, replaced with her combat suit. And when she said *'formal'*, her outfit changed to the formal one. "Wow, cool! So this is what nanotech can do, huh?", she said in awe.

"Now let's talk about body augmentation", Jonathan said, calmly. "Body augmentation? For me? I'm going to be a superhuman?", Estella asked curiously, a bit mocking. "Yes, you're right. Your muscle strength and metabolism will exceed what normal human can have. Actually, you can hardly be called a human after the procedures. And it will be permanent", Jonathan laid his explanation seriously. Estella, who caught Jonathan's tone, became serious too. "Permanent, huh? How high an increase are you talking about? And how safe?", she asked back. "Each of your body part's strength will be MULTIPLIED —*not increased*— by about 25.6 times. If you have seen a superhero movie in which the main character's body was injected by a blue serum, you'll be three times stronger than them. And yes, it's safe. The risk of failure for your body condition is about 0.05 percent".

Estella's eyes widened, "That strong?! What the hell, Jonathan?! In what world does that kind of superhuman exists?! If it is, on what base can you assure me that it's REALLY safe?!".

A big hologram display that looked like the one in Jonathan's office earlier showed up on the wall. There could be seen some photos and videos. There's a schema of human's spine, a video of a man running so fast —*faster than a race car*, a video of a man lifting a massive stone with ease on a cliff. And the men in the video was one man, it was ... Jonathan.

"Because I have experimented it on my own body"

### Story

Samantha opened her eyes on her bed. It was 6 AM, as per usual. She uncovered her blanket, revealing her body in black nightgown. Memories of the day before flashed quickly in her mind. Jonathan introduced a girl with a wolf cut dark blue hair, her expression was sharp and her eyes sharper. But how she carried herself showed a rare kind of elegance. Her slender body and a sword attached on her hip just highlighted the elegance all the more. *'A fox'*, she said in her mind. Her motherly instinct to Jonathan lit up immediately. Evaluating whether the girl was a threat or not. But even after a day of interactions, she hasn't reached a conclusion. She set the thought away for now.

Samantha stood up gracefully. Rays of morning sun from her all glass window bathe her body. She walked to her en suite bath room, shedding her nightgown on the way. Her beautiful figure and curves looked like a silhouette of a goddess from the other side of her room. The bathroom door then closed with a 'click' after she entered.

A few hours later, Samantha was already sitting in her office. Operating her computer and making some queries, she started digging deeper into Golden Serpent Tong. Not long after, she already collected a bunch of digital records documenting their movements for 2 years. Turns out the organization weren't so dead to not be able to revive. Jonathan was right, another hand was in play in their movements. A lot of accounting records proved it. Now her objective became clear.

"Now I just have to follow the money", she mumbled. She spent the next hour collecting more accounting records and compiling it. It was a very complicated flow of money. *'Who the hell in mafia world did fund transfers this meticulous? This will take me too long to figure out'*, she said in her mind. A new node of data was created filled with her finding. *'I'll just ask AEGIS to figure this out'*.

"AEGIS, wake up", she called.

*"Good day, Miss"*, a cybernetic voice answered her from her office's speaker.

"Track the accounting records in this node, it's from Golden Serpent Tong. Find if there's any connecting line with Jonathan's attack", she commanded.

*"Very well, Miss. Commencing analysis"*.

*'That will take a while'*.

Samantha suddenly reminded of her curiosity from yesterday about Estella. She immediately opened up a new data node, she named it *Fox Girl*. "Let's find out more about you, shall we?", she said before starting the search. 

Minutes turned to hours, Samantha was deeply engrossed in her search for Estella's background. 

"Hmm, military covert operations, black ops, is that her specialty? Sounds like danger to Jonathan. Wait, Japan, 2019. This is weird, she was assigned for a long time there". Samantha found records of her assignment in Japan, a lot of it has been redacted or covered. *'What happened there?'*

*"Analysis done"*, Samantha jerked up from AEGIS's sudden wake.

*"Total data stream analyzed: 106.8 Gigabytes. Summary: Golden Serpent Tong's source of money can be categorized into three big sources, all of them leads to different account in three different countries"*. Samantha's monitor showed a table with three columns labeled Spain, UAE, and South Africa. All columns filled with dates, origins, destinations, and amounts of different transactions.

*"For now, a single conclusion cannot be made. There are too many unrelated data clouding the whole analysis"*, AEGIS concluded the analysis. Samantha's eyes widened.

*'Cannot be concluded?! This should just be a small time mafia organization's funding. What's complicated about it?!'*, Samantha's rage surfaced in her mind.

"Do I have to do it myself? Jonathan will hear my complain about his stupid AI later", she thought out loud. She started to analyze the transaction records manually. Little did she know that it will take her a long time to find something useful

"Don't move", Jonathan said in a control room. "I'm not moving", Estella replied, strapped in an MRI device. About 45 minutes later, her bed started moving outwards the machine. "All done. You can get dressed again", said Jonathan. Estella silently stood up, discarded her hospital gown and don her formal nano suit. Looking all stylish again, she got out of the examination room.

Jonathan's phone rang, a call from Samantha. 

*How did a phone call reach an underground base, you ask? Wifi, guys. It was an internet call. Get used to it.*

*"Hi, Jonathan"*.

"Yes, Samantha. What's up?". Estella came into the control room, Jonathan put the phone on speaker.

*"It's about the Golden Serpent Tong, Jonathan. I can't find anything useful about them. It's all a jumbled mess"*.

"Jumbled mess? What are you talking about?", said Jonathan, confused.

*"I started digging into it this morning and already found traces of where their money came from. Simple enough, I thought. Just follow the money, right?"*

"Yeah, like usual"

*"Then I compiled the accounting data and fed it to your stupid AI to analyze. It did the analysis for about an hour only to return nothing"*.

Jonathan's eye twitched when she mentioned AEGIS as 'stupid AI'. "Hey, hey, tone down the insult, okay?", he said with a chuckle. "What do you mean nothing?".

*"Nothing as in 'conclusion cannot be made' it said"*

"What?!". Jonathan built AEGIS, so he knew what it can or cannot do. And making sense of some accounting transactions was something that it could easily do. Unless ...

*"So I started analyzing it myself. And I too can't make any sense of it, beside of some holes where the money doesn't have any record, just missing. I've sent you the node, look at it."*

*'Exactly'*, Jonathan said in his mind. *'Unless they deliberately did the exchange off the record, meaning they handed the money by hand'*.

"I'm seeing it right now, the last locations before it disappeared are mostly in Spain, UAE, and South Africa".

*"Correct"*.

"Fine. Looks like we can't figure this out fast without breaking some rules".

*"Which rules are you talking about?"*

"I don't know yet. I just started to prepare for Estella's procedures. I didn't think it will be this complicated".

*"What?! Procedures?! You guys already want to start?!"*, Samantha yelled from across the call. Like a mother yelling at her children.

"It turned out that way. I didn't think she'll agree to it this fast too", Jonathan stealing glances to Estella. The girl in question just shrugged.

*"Urgh ... Choose, Jonathan. You can't handle both"*, Samantha receded with a sigh and just gave Jonathan a tactical advice.

"I know. My hunch said that Estella is the more important one now", Jonathan said. *'Hunch again?'*, Estella said in her mind.

*"As usual, I trust your hunch"*, Samantha confirmed. *"I'll continue to dig more into this. In the meantime, I'll pray for both of you. Is Estella there?"*.

Jonathan glanced at Estella, signaling her to answer. "Yes, ma'am, I'm listening", she immediately answered.

*"Let's have a drink, Estella. Just both of us, before your procedures"*.

"Uh, ma'am?", Estella was confused. Jonathan quickly interrupt, "Based on her examination, we will do the procedures tomorrow. So I will not allow her to consume alcohol".

*"Then I'll be the one drinking, Jonathan. Make it happen, usual place. It's still 8pm, I'll be waiting at 9"*, Samantha commanded.

"Yes, mom", Jonathan said, rolling his eyes. The call ended.

"Tomorrow?!", Estella quickly shouted. Jonathan turned around, astonished. "Yes, tomorrow! Can you not yell at me?", he shouted back. "I'm sorry", Estella quickly apologized. "I was just ... surprised. Didn't think it will be that fast".

Jonathan softened, feeling guilty for shouting back at her. "It's okay, don't apologize. I'm not used to working with other people. Samantha is so ... understanding of me". He paused. "And yes it has to be tomorrow. I have to calculate the possibility of follow up attempt from them. And your recovery will take a week".

"I ... understand", Estella was taken aback by Jonathan's sudden openness. Something she don't know was possible. 

"Come on let's go to the hangar", Jonathan stood up

Forty five minutes later, they landed on Stream Headquarters's rooftop. "Where's the place?", Estella asked while they walked to the elevator. "Not far, about ten minutes drive". They entered the elevator and descended to the basement parking.

Two line of cars can be seen in front of them, all Jonathan's. There's yellow Camaro, black-blue Veyron, silver SLS, the only thing missing was ... Peterbilt 379? Blue paint with flame livery?. "Are these all ... normal cars?", Estella asked hesitantly. Afraid that Jonathan will say something like *"Nope, they can fly"* or *"They can shoot missiles"* or some other weird thing.

"Nope, they are all Transformers", Jonathan said. "What the fâ€”", Estella already prepared to yell. "They're all normal for god sake. I'm not that weird, you know", Jonathan quickly revised. "Come on, Samantha's waiting".

Jonathan tool her to his matte black Porsche 911 Turbo S, stealth choice. And they drove away.

<center>***</center>

Samantha was waiting in a luxury lounge of a high-class bar she regularly visited. Estella and Jonathan emerged from the door.

"Good evening, madam. Here is your delivery", Jonathan said, bowing his head. Estella walked inside while squinting at Jonathan's antic.

"Thank you, Mr. Delivery Man. You can go", Samantha said, smiling.

"Yeah, I'm out of place anyway", Jonathan shrugged. He was in his T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. "Call me when you're done, I'll pick you up with a Transformer", he said to Estella before walking away.

"Where are you going?", Estella half-yelled at the already gone Jonathan.

"Probably playing with his toys at the office", Samantha answered in his stead. "Always a lovely boy isn't he?", Samantha asked after turning her gaze to Estella.

"He is", Estella answered shortly, not thinking. *'What? Lovely? I confirmed that? Stupid brain'*, Estella grumbled inside his head. Not realizing her gaze became awkward and her cheeks started blushing.

*'A lovely girl you are too'*, Samantha thought. "What will you have, Estella?", Samantha asked to calm her down. Estella snapped from her mind-travel, "I can't drink tonight, ma'am".

"Oh, yeah I forgot. And stop it with the ma'am. Just call me Samantha", Samantha said while ordering a Macallan 30 for her.

"I don't think I can do that so soon, ma'am", Estella answered. "You are someone I've admired and respected for so long". Samantha looked at her with unexplainable expression at her answer. *'Disobeying a direct order, huh?'*. But she let it slide. 

The waiter came with a glass of Macallan 30 and a bottle of water. "I've done some digging about you earlier this afternoon", she said instead. 

"Digging ... on me?", Estella confused at her confession.

"Yes, it's always my instinct to ensure whoever in close contact with Jonathan is not a threat. While I found a lot of interesting thing about you. One thing especially caught my eyes".

"And what is that, ma'am?"

"You are the sole heir of Onami-ryÅ«, aren't you? At least unofficially".

Estella's eyes widen, shocked by Samantha's question. That name was a secret she hide so meticulously â€”for her master's safetyâ€” even the military didn't find out about it. But if Samantha already found out about it then she didn't need to hide her pride away.

"Yes, I am", she spoke with a calm tone, the calmness of the great ocean. It was reflected in her eyes.

Samantha saw her eyes and felt it, her pride in the legacy. "Why did you hide it?", she followed.

"Because I'm ashamed that I couldn't complete the teaching. I chose my work instead. I have to protect my master's pride and honor", she said. Unwavering.

"Very well, Estella. That concludes my evaluation on you. You're not a threat", Samantha said, leaning back on the plush couch.

Estella raised her eyebrow, "What do you mean? You concluded that I'm not a threat just by knowing my sword style?".

"No, I did because of your reason and resolve for hiding it. I know how powerful Onami-ryÅ« is, Estella. Deflecting bullets is something you can easily do, and you know it too".

Estella just kept quiet, didn't deny any of it.

"You already saw what kind of powers Jonathan's procedures hold too. And he have already trust you with it, based on his 'hunch'". Estella nodded quickly at the mention of Jonathan's hunch. "That power will only enhance what you already have. Whether you know of it or not. If you have the resolve to hide your master's legacy and not using it for your own benefits then I trust that you will do the same for Jonathan's too".

Estella nodded solemnly, Samantha's words reminded her of her reflection yesterday. "Thank you for trusting me, ma'am".

"So, have you slept with Jonathan yet?"

Estella immediately choked on her water. "Cough.. Cough.. Excuse me, ma'am?"

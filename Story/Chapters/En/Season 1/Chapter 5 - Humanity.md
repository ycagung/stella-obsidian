### Story

A big hologram display that looked like the one in Jonathan's office earlier showed up on the wall. There could be seen some photos and videos. There's a schema of human's spine, a video of a man running so fast —*faster than a race car*, a video of a man lifting a massive stone with ease on a cliff. And the men in the video was one man, it was ... Jonathan.

"Because I have experimented it on my own body", said Jonathan. Cold and expressionless.

Estella was stunned, her eyes wide. *'This serum is his creation? He experimented using his own body? Is that even possible? What kind of crazy person injected a crazy serum into his own body? So he's crazy on top of being a genius?'*, her thoughts was running here and there filled with questions. Jonathan who saw her rigid expression tried to soften his.

"I know you must have a lot of questions in your mind. Just ask me. No rush. Maybe you'll ask the right question", he said.

Estella took a long deep breath and managed to calm herself. "Okay, so you made this serum?", her first big question.

"Correct, all these procedures are mine", he answered.

"All these? So not just a serum?", Estella asked a follow up.

The hologram screen displayed two images, the right one was a vial containing yellow liquid, and the left one was a human spine schema attached with some mechanical components. "There are two procedures. A serum to enhance your muscle strength and metabolism, then modifying your spine with cybernetic components to enhance your nervous system, thus greater reflex response. Because great power without control is nonsense", he explained in detail.

"Okay", Estella took another deep breath. "Who knows about these procedures?", second big question.

"Only me and Samantha, and now you. There's no one in this world —other than you two— that I can trust to have access to these procedures. Hence, the underground construction. And that was why I experimented on my own body".

"Then why me? Why now?", her final big question.

"Do you know why the serum and the cybernetics works on me?", Jonathan answered her question with another question.

"Why?"

"Because my brain capacity exceeds normal people's", Jonathan paused. "Strength enhancement without also enhancing the nervous system equals uncontrolled strength. On the other hand, a nervous system enhancement with overload your brain with an order of magnitude more information. My brain can handle that much information. But regular person's brain? It will just be fried instantly and followed by a coma, if not death". Jonathan then showed the clip where Estella deflected bullet multiple times. "You —*turns out*— have an outstanding brain capacity too. Proofs is on the display, you can deflect something that fast even without cybernetic modifications. You will be able to use this cybernetics well, and that's precisely why I said the risk of failure is just 0.05 percent".

Estella listened to Jonathan's explanation calmly. She actually didn't realize that her brain was as good as what Jonathan said. But the explanation gave her new images on how she looked at herself.

"As to 'why now', my guts said that I will not be able to hold onto this secret alone much longer. I need help".

"You talked a lot about hunch and what your guts said from earlier. You had a hunch that I'll be able to do this secret security job well. When instead you already calculated my brain capacity and planned to offer me these body augmentation. Your hunches are closer to a precise calculation from my standpoint", she retorted playfully.

"What? Calculation? Me? Nah, it's in your head. I don't know what you're talking about", Jonathan shrugged, feigned ignorance of her claims. Estella sneered at him and crossed her arms.

"Okay, okay. You still need to think about this. I won't force you to agree to undergo the procedures. After all, it will be a permanent change to your body—".

"Wait, one more question", she interrupted. "Do you know or have predicted the long term effects?"

"Ah, so this serum and cybernetics have been in my body for 3 years already. No abnormality or complication until now. I predicted that there will be none in your body too. The longest term effect that I can think of is, maybe a slight prolonging of your lifespan".

"How long?"

"I don't know for sure. Two hundred years maybe? I can't confirm it too —*I'm still alive as you can see*", Jonathan shrugged.

"TWO HUNDRED YEARS?! ARE YOU MAD?! But ... if this kind of invention goes to the wrong hand, then, it will cause destruction", she mumbled after being surprised.

"That's why, just think about it first. Are you ready to be a building leaping grandma or not?", Jonathan chuckled. Hearing that joke, Estella too started chuckling. Her first laugh after meeting Jonathan. "Cool grandma, with a sword", she added. They laughed together.

Late night, full moon shone bright. Estella stood by herself on the rooftop, leaning her elbows to the railings made of glass. Her eyes looking at the sky, gazing at the moon and shining stars. Still wearing the same formal outfit, her blazer fluttered, hit by the night wind. Her dark outfit blended with the darkness of the night. Estella did this almost every night, pondering over the stars —regardless of where she was. The view always calmed her after a long day filled with dangerous missions.

*'I am a human'*, she thought. Like she was just realizing her true self after Jonathan said *"It'll be difficult to call you human after the procedures"*.

*'What is a human? What defines a human? Is it the body? or the mind?'*, she was drowning deeper in her contemplation.

*'If the body defines it, then that means I will really no longer be one after I undergo the procedures? That means Jonathan is already thinking of himself as a non-human?*

*'But if the mind defines it, that means I will still be one, right? But what mind is it?'*

Questions after questions surfaced on her mind with answer to none.

*"Maybe you'll ask the right question"*, suddenly she was reminded of Jonathan's words at the lab. Out of nowhere, a memory of Yoshida-san, her swordsmanship master surfaced.

<center>***</center>

*It was noon. A year after Estella started to learn under the tutelage of Yoshida-san. Her heart and soul was burning, looking for power to realize her revenge to whoever killed her parents. But on that particular day, none of her attacks was successful against Yoshida-san. She was so tired, still looking for ways for her sword to reach Yoshida-san. Sweating profusely, her breath short. Yoshida-san lowered his weapon and said to Estella.*

*"Stella, the right answer will only appear once you ask the right question. If someday confusion clouded your mind, too many question, none answered. Maybe you are asking the wrong question", he said to exhausted Estella.*

*Estella at the time didn't understand what her master said at all. She then collapsed from  exhaustion in front of Yoshida-san.*

<center>***</center>

Her eyes widened, *'I was asking the wrong question!'*.

*'It's never about if I'm a human or not. Never about what I can do nor about what Jonathan can do. Never about all of it. But what then? What is the right question?*, Estella felt the path to her complicated mind opened a little. But she still couldn't pass through. She was frustrated, her eyes closed, veins started popping on her forehead and neck.

"Can't sleep?", Jonathan's husky voice sent her back to the real world with a jolt. Estella quickly turned to her back and found Jonathan walking out of the rooftop door, wearing a white T-shirt and black sweatpants. His after bath wet hair swayed by the night wind and moonlight shone on his face. One of his hand was in his pocket and the other one was holding a glass of hot coffee. Estella's expression softened. Gone has her earlier tension and frustration. *'Why is he so handsome right now? Even though his attitude was so annoying*, she said in her mind.

*'Why is his face shining as it bathe in the moonlight? Why is her wet hair so beautifully swayed by the winds? Why is a nerd like him can have that kind of toned muscles? Why is he so breathtaking right now?'*, her roundabout questions kept coming back to the same one. Suddenly her eyes widen again. *'Why him?'*, she repeated in her mind. She found the right question.

"Why did you create those augmentation procedures?", she asked. Jonathan was a little taken aback by her sudden question out of nowhere. But he understood.

"You finally asked the right question", he replied with a smile. Jonathan walked closer to Estella, then started to tell his story.

"I created my own version of nanotechnology to cure human diseases. The right now incurable diseases. I tried to reconstruct various protein chains —*more than 200 million of them*— using that. Without me realizing it, my simulations showed that the chains aren't curing diseases no longer. I changed human cell's molecular structure. Therefore, be the serum". Jonathan paused to sip his coffee. "Humans are precious to me, and humanity is even more so. There's a beauty when we look at ourselves as a species. Struggling with realities filled with desires, killed by despairs, but resurrected by hope", his gaze turned to the moon. "This serum discarded the fundamental element of humanity from a person's body. Release it to the masses and the balance will shift and broke right away. I don't want to see that kind of thing happen".

Estella was stupefied at Jonathan's explanations. She was ashamed, of her mere confusion about she will still be human or not. Of her heart that only concerned about herself. Meanwhile, Jonathan was trying to cure human diseases and guard the world's balance. Even though he has to bear the heavy burden of his own creation. And in the middle of his struggles, Jonathan could still acknowledge that maybe he wouldn't be able to hold the secret burden all to himself any longer. Estella started to see Jonathan in a completely new light.

Jonathan turned his gaze from the full moon to Estella's face. Her expression was soft yet held back, like she was thinking of something. *'For sure she is thinking of something'*, he said in his mind. On one hand, he felt a pang of guilt for suddenly placing a burden this big onto her shoulder. Even if she rejected the augmentation procedures, she still has to bear the burden of this secret. A new appreciation for Estella surfaced on Jonathan's mind.

They were just standing there, in silence. Until Estella broke that silence.

"I'll do it", her face full of determination, rid of any hesitation whatsoever. Jonathan smiled.
